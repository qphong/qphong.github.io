# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I am supervised by [Professor Patrick Jaillet](https://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). My research focuses on
* Bayesian optimization,
* Active learning,

and other areas such as meta-learning, fairness in collaborative machine learning, machine unlearning, explainable AI, and inverse reinforcement learning.

Currently, I am focusing on devising a general approach that unifies several problems related to Bayesian optimization.

# Recently
* *I am looking for jobs in USA and Australia.*
* I am thrilled to share the exciting news that our [meta Bayesian optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ElykcDu5YK) and [constrained Bayesian optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=D4NJFfrqoq) have been accepted for poster presentation at ICLR 2024.
* [Oct 17, 2023 @Phoenix, Arizona] I presented *Optimizing Value-at-risk And Conditional Value-at-risk Of Black-box Functions* at Bayesian Optimization session at **2023 INFORMS Annual Meeting**.
