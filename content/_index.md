# Welcome
I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where I am supervised by Professor Patrick Jaillet. My research focuses on several areas, including Bayesian optimization, active learning, meta-learning, fairness in collaborative machine learning, machine unlearning, explainable AI, and inverse reinforcement learning.

Currently, I am focusing on devising a general approach that unifies several problems related to Bayesian optimization.
